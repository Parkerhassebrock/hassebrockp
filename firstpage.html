        in the shade of a nearby convienence store doing his utmost best to stay cool. Unfortunately, since Edward is so broke, he can't afford
        working air conditioning at his old run down appartment, so he wonders the city trying to find anything that can keep him cool. While
        he would settle for some water or anything cold, what he truly desires is the ice-cold taste of Mug root beer.<br>
